# usb-ssh-key

## What?

Helper script for carrying around your (hopefully encrypted) SSH key on a USB.

Plus bonus instructions for making those dirt cheap USB drives useful again.

## Why?

**For the purist pair programmer**  
You use pairing machines. You rotate pairs often. You use [git-duet].
But you use a shared key that's stored on the machine, the horror!
Do yourself a favour and get your own key on your slick USB drive.
Plug, load, unplug, pair, rotate, repeat.

**For the security conscious**
